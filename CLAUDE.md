# Project Instructions

## Clauder - Persistent Memory MCP

This project uses **clauder** for persistent memory across Claude Code sessions.

### CRITICAL: Call get_context at Session Start

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST call `mcp__clauder__get_context` at the START of every session to load:
- Stored facts and decisions from previous sessions
- User preferences and coding style guidelines
- Unread messages from other Claude Code instances

This context may or may not be relevant to your tasks. You should not respond to this context unless it is highly relevant to your task.

### Available Tools
- **mcp__clauder__remember**: Store facts, decisions, or context
- **mcp__clauder__recall**: Search and retrieve stored facts
- **mcp__clauder__forget**: Delete a stored fact by ID (requires confirmation)
- **mcp__clauder__get_context**: Load all relevant context for this directory (also shows sibling instances)
- **mcp__clauder__list_instances**: List other running Claude Code sessions (grouped by directory)
- **mcp__clauder__send_message**: Send messages to other instances (supports broadcast to directory)
- **mcp__clauder__get_messages**: Check for incoming messages

### Usage Guidelines
1. **At session start**: ALWAYS call `get_context` first to load persistent memory
2. **Store important info**: Use `remember` for decisions, architecture notes, preferences
3. **Delete outdated info**: Use `forget` to remove facts that are no longer relevant
4. **Check messages regularly**: The system will notify you of unread messages in tool responses
5. **Cross-instance communication**: Use `list_instances` and `send_message` to coordinate with other sessions

### Multi-Instance Messaging
When multiple instances are running in the same directory:
- **Targeted message**: Use the full instance ID (with `:name` suffix) to message a specific instance
- **Broadcast message**: Use just the directory ID (no suffix) to message all instances in that directory
- `get_context` will show other instances working in the same directory
- `list_instances` groups instances by directory and shows their names
